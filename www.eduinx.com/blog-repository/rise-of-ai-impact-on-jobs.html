        <!-- ==  BLOG CONTENT ============ -->
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>With artificial intelligence playing a vital role in revolutionizing operations across industries, many young
          professionals are bound to be worried about their job security. Is AI an evil entity that would take away many
          jobs or would it aid employees in performing tasks? With the rise in AI jobs in India, gen AI jobs are the
          most sought after. Read on to know more about the impact of AI on jobs. </p><br>

        <h3>Impact on Employment</h3>
        <p>As the current job market changes due to changing trends and the impact of gen AI, new jobs emerge. There
          will be a significant impact on unemployment rates but at the same time, new job requirements will also emerge
          due to an increase in demand for AI-based skills. AI creates new opportunities that demand skills like
          critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Jobs that are repetitive and mundane are likely to be
          replaced by AI, so professionals who work in industries that rely on routine tasks have to upgrade their skill
          sets in order to survive in the current AI-driven workspace. </p><br>
        <p>If you are a professional with nearly a decade of experience under your belt, the ideal option for you would
          be to upgrade your skills in AI, machine learning, and data science to sustain in the market. Here are a few
          new job roles that you can take up if you learn gen AI and data science along with your current skill set.
        </p><br>

        <h3>New Job Roles</h3>
        <p>If you are into mentoring and training, you can become an AI teacher or trainer who teaches AI systems to
          implement new learning concepts. For instance, an AI trainer will ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of AI
          algorithms. They will also develop new AI applications and systems that suit students and resonate with the
          current industry requirements. If you are a data analyst, you can learn gen AI and data science to interpret
          data quickly and efficiently, contributing to the overall growth of the organization. You can use AI tools to
          analyze data, frame insights, and identify patterns that can help the business make informed decisions. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Did you know that there is a growing need for professionals who can manage the interaction between humans and
          machines? This role is known as human-machine teaming managers. These managers are responsible to establish
          effective practices, ensuring that AI systems work with human resources effectively. AI ethics and policy
          specialists are on high demand as it is important for organizations to ensure compliance with ethical
          policies. These specialists use their expertise to ensure that all AI systems are used ethically and comply
          with the privacy policy. </p><br>

        <h3>Impact on the Global Economy</h3>
        <p>AI has revolutionized the current market by improving productivity and output, stimulating economic growth by
          many folds. It has a positive impact on the economy with an improved turnover due to optimized operations and
          cost reduction. However, there are also a few concerns regarding the possibility of widening the wealth gap as
          employees with gen AI and data science skills will be paid more than the ones who lack these skills. There is
          also a significant impact of AI on jobs in India due to changing trends in data analytics and machine
          learning.</p><br>

        <h3>Will AI Replace Jobs?</h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, AI is not going to replace humans, at least not in the near future. This is
          because companies will need more human resources to monitor AI-generated outputs as they may not be as
          accurate as predicted. When it comes to the impact of AI on jobs, did you know that AI will have displaced 75
          million jobs by the end of 2025 but is estimated to create <a
            href="https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/ai-statistics" target="_blank"
            style="display: inline; color: deepskyblue;"><strong>133 million</strong></a> new jobs by the year 2030?
          There is bound to be a significant job displacement in certain industries, however, this will depend on the
          region and certain industries. It is estimated that there may be a surge in job growth in the education and
          healthcare industries as there is a constant demand for data scientists and gen AI professionals. The answer
          is that the rise of AI will replace a few jobs but if you up skill yourself and learn the basics of data
          science and gen AI, your job will remain secure. </p><br>

        <h3>Job Trends in the Era of AI</h3>
        <p>With unanticipated opportunities due to significant breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence,
          professionals and freshers skilled in AI and data science are sure to land a job in a reputed organization.
          Here are some current job trends in the AI era. </p><br>

        <p>AI has redefined several job responsibilities due to automation, leading to a rise in demand for new skills
          while recruiting candidates. Also, AI demands the need for a dynamic workforce that is more adaptable and open
          to learning new technologies, thereby improving skills. Traditional industries are now seeing a change in
          dynamics as conventional manufacturing has now transformed into smart factories with AI-driven production and
          maintenance. Also, emerging entrepreneurs can broaden their scope to support economic expansion and
          recruitment with AI technology.</p><br>

        <p>Industries now emphasize on quality over quantity of skilled resources when it comes to hiring, thanks to the
          emergence of AI. This new technology has paved the way for organizations to invest in reskilling and
          continuous up skilling with the ever-changing nature of work. Another increasing trend is the emphasis on
          handling ethical issues by eliminating prejudice and ensuring inclusion. There has also been an increase in
          generative AI jobs across several industries. </p><br>

        <h3>Why Choose Gen AI as a Career?</h3>
        <p>Regardless of which industry you are working for or are aiming to start your career as a fresher, AI and data
          science play a pivotal role in every organization. Learning gen AI and data science with machine learning is
          sure to take you miles ahead in your job and reinforce your skills to face the current competitive world. As
          an AI expert, you can enhance your productivity and reach a higher potential. It also helps you automate some
          of the mundane tasks that you perform and channel your focus on other areas to master multiple interconnected
          capabilities in one go. This will make you an established professional in the AI-driven market and become a
          desirable candidate for recruiters.</p><br>
